# Hello and welcome to my coding portfolio!
My name is Muneer-Raza, and I'm a passionate GCSE Student with experience in a variety of programming languages, including C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more. I've always been fascinated by the power of technology to solve complex problems and improve people's lives, and that's what inspired me to pursue a career in software development. Over the years, I've worked on a wide range of projects, from simple websites and web applications to complex mobile apps and desktop software.
