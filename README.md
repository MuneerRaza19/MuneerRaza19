<h1>Hi, I'm Muneer! <br/><a href="https://github.com/MuneerRaza19">Programmer</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in//">
  
# Hello and welcome to my coding portfolio!
My name is Muneer-Raza, and I'm a passionate programmer with experience in a variety of programming languages, including C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more. I've always been fascinated by the power of technology to solve complex problems and improve people's lives, and that's what inspired me to pursue a career in software development. Over the years, I've worked on a wide range of projects, from simple websites and web applications to complex mobile apps and desktop software.

One of my favorite projects was a mobile app that I developed for a local non-profit organization. The app was designed to help volunteers manage their schedules, track their hours, and connect with other volunteers in the community. I used a combination of C# and Xamarin to build the app, and I was thrilled to see how it helped the organization streamline their operations and improve their impact.

Another project that I'm particularly proud of is a web app that I developed for a startup company. The app was designed to help users find and book appointments with local service providers, such as hair stylists, massage therapists, and personal trainers. I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the app, and I was excited to see how it helped the company grow and expand their services.

In addition to these projects, I've also worked on a variety of other coding challenges and experiments, from building simple games and animations to exploring the latest machine learning and AI technologies. I'm always eager to learn new skills and explore new ideas, and I'm excited to see where my coding journey will take me next.

So take a look around my portfolio, and feel free to get in touch if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project. I'm always happy to connect with fellow developers and explore new opportunities!
